- The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s): In the 1960s and 1970s, as software systems grew in complexity, the need for better organization of code became evident. Structured programming emerged as a response to early software development practices' chaotic and error-prone nature.
- The Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s): Object-oriented programming (OOP) became popular in the 1980s as a way to better manage software complexity by modelling software around "objects," which represent both data and behaviours.
- The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001): In 2001, a group of software developers created the Agile Manifesto, which emphasized a flexible, iterative approach to software development in contrast to the traditional Waterfall model. Agile methodologies focus on continuous feedback, collaboration, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements throughout the development process.


QUESTION3: List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

ANSWER: 
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


QUESTION4: Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

ANSWER: Waterfall methodology is a traditional project management approach that involves completing project phases in a linear and sequential manner. Each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to specialization of tasks. Appropriate Scenarios for Waterfall Methodology is Well-Defined Projects with clear, fixed requirements and scope, where changes are unlikely. Example: Construction projects, where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Agile methodology in comparison to waterfall methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development that focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases. It is designed to be flexible and adaptive to change. Appropriate scenario for the Agile methodology is Projects with Cross-Functional Teams, environments where collaboration among diverse skill sets is essential. Example: Developing web services requiring coordination between designers, developers, and marketers.


QUESTION5: Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

ANSWER: 
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
